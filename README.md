Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Objective: To create a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other.
Features:
The game should display a 3x3 grid where players can place their marks (X or O).
Players take turns to place their marks until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
The game should check for a win condition (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal) after each move.
The game should display the winner or a draw message at the end of the game.
The game should allow players to restart the game after it ends.
Implementation:
This is a basic implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking the board until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw. Players can reset the game or start a new game.
Here's a brief overview of the code:
HTML: The HTML contains a grid of boxes (div elements) where players can make their moves. It also includes buttons for resetting the game and starting a new game,as well as a message container to display game messages.
CSS: The CSS styles the game board, boxes, buttons, and message container to create a simple and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: The JavaScript code handles the game logic, including tracking player turns, checking for a winner, and displaying game messages.
It uses event listeners to respond to player clicks on the boxes and buttons.
Optional Features:
Allow players to choose their marks (X or O).
Add a scoring system to keep track of wins, losses, and draws.
